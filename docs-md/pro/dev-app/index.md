# Using the Ionic Dev App

The Ionic Dev App is a free app that makes it easy to run your Ionic app directly on your device.

Skip dealing with frustrating Native SDK installation issues, just run `ionic serve`, open the Dev App, connect to the same network, and the app will automatically load
and run your app. The Dev App comes with many native plugins built right in, so you don't need to worry about installing plugins.

# Download the Dev App

The Dev App is available on iOS and Android.
