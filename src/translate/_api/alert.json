For example, an alert could have all radio button inputs, or all checkbox inputs, but the same alert cannot mix radio and checkbox inputs. Do note however, different types of \"text\" inputs can be mixed, such as <code>url</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>text</code>, etc. If you require a complex form UI which doesn't fit within the guidelines of an alert then we recommend building the form within a modal instead.</p>\n",
