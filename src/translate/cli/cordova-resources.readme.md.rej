- Ionic can automatically generate perfectly sized icons and splash screens from source images (**.png**, **.psd**, or **.ai**) for your Cordova platforms.
  
  The source image for icons should ideally be at least **1024×1024px** and located at **resources/icon.png**. The source image for splash screens should ideally be at least **2732×2732px** and located at **resources/splash.png**. If you used `ionic start`, there should already be default Ionic resources in the **resources/** directory, which you can overwrite.
  
  You can also generate platform-specific icons and splash screens by placing them in the respective **resources/<platform>/** directory. For example, to generate an icon for Android, place your image at **resources/android/icon.png**.
  
- By default, this command will not regenerate resources whose source image has not changed. To disable this functionality and always overwrite generated images, use `--force`.
- 
  For best results, the splash screen's artwork should roughly fit within a square (**1200×1200px**) at the center of the image. You can use **[https://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd](https://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd)** as a template for your splash screen.
  
  `ionic cordova resources` will automatically update your **config.xml** to reflect the changes in the generated images, which Cordova then configures.

- With the experimental `--cordova-res` option, `ionic cordova resources` will generate resources locally using the `cordova-res` [utility](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-res).--- 1,15 ----
