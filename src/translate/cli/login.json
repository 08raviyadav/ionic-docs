To retrieve your user token, first use `ionic login`, then print the token by running the `ionic config get -g tokens.user` command.\n\nYou can also use `IONIC_EMAIL` and `IONIC_PASSWORD` environment variables for automatic authentication, but it is not recommended to store your password in plain text.\n\nIf you need to create an Ionic Appflow account, use `ionic signup`.\n\nIf you are having issues logging in, please get in touch with our [Support](https://ion.link/support-request).",
