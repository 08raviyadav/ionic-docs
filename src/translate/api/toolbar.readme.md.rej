  ### Borders
  
- In `md` mode, the `<ion-header>` will receive a box-shadow on the bottom, and the `<ion-footer>` will receive a box-shadow on the top.  In `ios` mode, the `<ion-header>` will receive a border on the bottom, and the `<ion-footer>` will receive a border on the top. Both the `md` box-shadow and the `ios` border can be removed by adding the `no-border` attribute to the element.
