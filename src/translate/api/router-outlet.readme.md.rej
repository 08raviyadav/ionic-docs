  # ion-router-outlet
  
- Router Outlet is a component used in routing within an Angular app.
- Router Outlet behaves in a similar way as Angular's built-in Router Outlet component, but contains the logic for providing a stacked navigation, and animating views in and out.
  
  
- > Note: this is only meant for Angular projects. For vanilla JavaScript, use `ion-router` and `ion-route` instead.
- 
- While Router Outlet has methods for navigating around, it's recommended to use the navigation methods in Angular's router.
