# ion-router-link

The router link component is used for navigating to a specified link. Similar to the browser's anchor tag, it can accept a href for the location, and a direction for the transition animation.

> Note: this component should only be used with vanilla and Stencil JavaScript projects. For Angular projects, use an `<a>` and `routerLink` with the Angular router.
