This plugin handles deeplinks on iOS and Android for both custom URL scheme links
and Universal App Links.

Please read the [ionic plugin deeplinks docs](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-plugin-deeplinks) for iOS and Android integration.
You must add `universal-links` to your `config.xml` and set up Apple App Site Association (AASA) for iOS and Asset Links for Android.
