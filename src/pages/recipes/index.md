# Ionic Recipes

Building a great app requires more than just assembling together a few Ionic components. Think of the best apps you love using, chances are they don't look much like the stock iOS and Android designs!

One of the great things about building an app with Ionic is how much customization control you have. No only can you configure and theme every Ionic component, but building custom components in HTML/CSS/JS and making them wonderfully mobile-enabled using our gesture and animation utilities is easy.

To help developers build a powerful animation and gesture skillset for rich, custom UI experiences, we've put together a set of recipes and tutorials showing you how to build your own gesture and animation driven UI.
