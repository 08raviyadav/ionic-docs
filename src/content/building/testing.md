# Testing

## Angular

When an `ionic/angular` application is generated using the Ionic CLI, it is automatically set up to unit test the application using Jasmine. This is the same setup that is used by the Angular CLI. Refer to the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing" target="_blank">Angular Testing Guide</a> for detailed information on unit testing Angular applications.
