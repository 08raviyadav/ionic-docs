action-sheet

## Alert
 
Alerts are a great way to offer the user the ability to choose a specific action or list of actions. They also can provide the user with important information, or require them to make a decision (or multiple decisions). Alerts should only be used for quick actions like password verification, small app notifications, or quick options.

## Badge

The Badge component is a small component that typically communicates a numerical value to the user. They are normally used within an item. 

## Button

Buttons are an essential way to interact with and navigate through an app, and should clearly communicate what action will occur after the user taps them. Buttons are highly customizeable with color, shape and size being fully customizeable.

## Card

Card components are a great way to display important pieces of content, and are quickly emerging as a core design pattern for apps. Cards can contain images, buttons and more.

## Checkbox

A checkbox can be used to let the user know they need to make a binary decision. It provides a clear visual of either a true or false choice. ion-checkbox should always be used with ion-item. If you prefer the look of radio inputs, you can also use `ion-radio` or if you prefer toggles you can use `ion-toggle`.

## DateTime

DateTime is used to present an interface which makes it easy for users to select dates and times. Datetime will look like a native iOS date picker when rendered on an iOS device and will have a material look on all other platforms. Datetime should always be used within an `ion-item`.

## Fab

A floating action button (FAB) is a circular button that performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen. It floats above the content of the page and is normally colored either the primary or secondary color of the app.

## Grid

Grid is a powerful mobile-first system for building custom layouts. The Grid component can be used to ensure your app looks great on any device. It is heavily influenced by Bootstrap's grid system.

## Infinite Scroll

An infinite scroll allows you to perform an action when the user scrolls a specified distance from the bottom or top of the page. It is normally used to lazy load data for long lists and is also very customizeable.

## Input

Inputs allow users to enter data into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs. They should always be wrapped with an `ion-item`.

## List

The list component is used to display rows of information, such as a contact list, playlist, or menu. It can display cards, list items and more.

## Loading

Loading is an overlay that prevents user interaction while indicating activity.

## Menu

Menus are a common navigation pattern for apps. Menus can either be permanently on-screen (split-pane), swiped into view or toggled through a menu button.

## Modal

Modals slide in off screen to display a temporary UI, often used for login or signup pages, message composition, and option selection.

## Nav

Navigation is how users move between different pages in your app. Ionic’s navigation follows standard navigation concepts and animated transitions. Ionic's nav can also adapt to larger viewports using [ion-split-pane](link to split pane)


## Popover

The Popover is a view that floats above an app’s content. Popovers provide an easy way to present or gather information from the user and are commonly used in the following situations:

- Show more info about the current view
- Select a commonly used tool or configuration
- Present a list of actions to perform inside one of your views

## Range

A Range is a form control that lets users select from a range of values by moving a slider knob along the slider bar. Range must always be wrapped in an `ion-item`

## Refresher

Refresh provides pull-to-refresh functionality on a content component. A common use case for the refresher component is to reload data. 

## Searchbar

Searchbar is used to search or filter items. It is normally used inside an `ion-toolbar`.

## Select

The ion-select component is similar to an HTML <select> element, however, Ionic’s select component makes it easier for users to sort through and select the preferred option. It must be wrapped in an `ion-item`.

## Slides

Slides make it easy to create complex UI such as galleries, tutorials, and page-based layouts.

## Spinner

The `ion-spinner` component provides a variety of animated SVG spinners. Spinners enables you to give users feedback that the app is actively processing/thinking/waiting/chillin’ out, or whatever you’d like it to indicate.

## Tabs

Tabs enable tabbed navigation, a standard navigation pattern in modern apps. Tabs can display an icon and label to give the user visual feedback of where they are in the app.

## Toast

The toast component is a subtle notification that appears on top of an app’s content. The toast component can be used to display a short message to the user.

## Virtual Scroll

Virtual Scroll is a virtual list that allows you to performantly scroll through huge lists. Virtual Scroll only renders the items that are currently being viewed in the list.
