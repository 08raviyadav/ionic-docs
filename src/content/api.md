# Ionic API

![api header image](/docs/assets/img/api/api-intro-header.png)

In the API docs, you'll find two kinds of doc pages: Component and Programmatic APIs.

The Component APIs include classes like [`Checkbox`](/dev/api/checkbox), [`Toggle`](/docs/api/toggle) or [`Item`](/docs/api/item) and show you how to use them, in addition to listing their selectors, available properties and events.

The Programmatic APIs are classes like [`MenuController`](/dev/api/menu-controller), `Config` or `Platform`.
These are services provided by Ionic that can be injected into your classes.
