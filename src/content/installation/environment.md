# Environment Setup

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a [Node & npm](#anchor-node-npm) environment.
</p>

## Node & npm

Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in [Node.js](/docs/faq/glossary#node). The [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) has prebuilt installation packages for all platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

Node is bundled with [npm](/docs/faq/glossary#npm), the package manager for JavaScript.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

## Git

Although not required, the version control system [Git](/docs/faq/glossary#git) is highly recommended. First, install the command-line utility from the [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads). For a GUI client, we recommend [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
$ git --version
```

## Java

<blockquote>
  <p>Java 10 is still a bit too new and doesn't work well with Cordova. We recommend JDK8.</p>
</blockquote>

Building and publishing apps for [Android](https://www.android.com/) devices requires [Java](https://java.com/en/). Download JDK8 from the [download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

## Android Studio

Building and publishing apps for [Android](https://www.android.com/) devices requires [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), which includes the Android SDK.
