# CLI Install

The CLI can be installed globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

<blockquote>
  <p>The `-g` flag means packages are installed globally, possibly into directories owned by a superuser. Elevated privileges will be required if permission issues are encountered. For Windows, run Command Prompt as an Administrator. For other platforms, prefix the installation command with `sudo`.</p>
</blockquote>

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
ionic --version
```
