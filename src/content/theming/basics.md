# Theming Basics

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
We built Ionic to be a blank slate that can easily be customized and modified to fit a brand, while still following the standards of the different platforms. Weâ€™ve made theming Ionic apps easier than ever. Ionic is built with CSS, which allows us to set some default styles but makes it extremely easy to change our defaults.

## CSS Variables

All of the Ionic components are themed using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables" target="_blank">CSS properties (variables)</a>. CSS variables add dynamic values to an otherwise static language. This is something that has traditionally required a CSS preprocessor like Sass. The look of an application can easily be changed by changing the value of any of the [Ionic CSS Variables](./css-variables).

## Branding

Ionic provides application colors that can be used to theme an application to match a brand or color scheme. The default theme uses a light background, but everything from the background color to the text color is fully customizable. For more information on branding, see [Advanced Theming](./advanced).


## Colors

We provide 9 default colors that can be used to change the color of many Ionic components. Each color is actually a collection of multiple properties used throughout Ionic. When changing a color, it is important to set all of the related properties. We've made this easier by providing a [Color Generator](./color-generator) tool, but these can also be manually written if desired.
