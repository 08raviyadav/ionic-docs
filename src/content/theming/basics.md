# Theming Basics

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
We built Ionic to be a blank slate that can easily be customized and modified to fit a brand, while still following the standards of the different platforms. Weâ€™ve made theming Ionic apps easier than ever. Ionic is built with CSS, which allows us to set some default styles but makes it extremely easy to change our defaults.

## Colors

Ionic has nine default colors that can be used to change the color of many components. Each color is actually a collection of multiple properties used throughout Ionic. When changing a color, it is important to set all of the related properties. We've made this easier by providing a [Color Generator](./color-generator) tool, but these can also be manually written if desired.

## Platform Standards

Ionic components adapt their look and behavior based on the platform the application is running on. This allows developers to use the same codebase for multiple platforms, while still looking like native applications. Ionic has two **modes** that are used to customize the look of components based on the **platform**: `ios` and `md`. Each platform has a default mode, but this can easily be configured. For more information on customizing an application based on the platform, see [Platform Styles](./platform-styles).


## CSS Variables

All of the Ionic components are themed using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables" target="_blank">CSS properties (variables)</a>. CSS variables add dynamic values to an otherwise static language. This is something that has traditionally required a CSS preprocessor like Sass. The look of an application can easily be changed by changing the value of any of the [Ionic CSS Variables](./css-variables).


## Branding

Ionic provides application colors that can be used to theme an application to match a brand or color scheme. The default theme uses a light background, but everything from the background color to the text color is fully customizable. For more information on branding, see [Advanced Theming](./advanced).
