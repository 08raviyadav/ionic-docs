# Browser Support

Ionic's original goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies, such as simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With this core feature, Ionic is able  to work across a wide range of devices, operating systems and browsers, all while using the same codebase.


## Mobile

Browser support was first centered around supporting mobile devices through [Platform Continuity](/docs/intro/concepts#anchor-platform-continuity), and has been heavily tested on the operating systems listed below:

- Android 4.4+
  - [Latest Android Stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/)
  - Android 4.1-4.3 using [Crosswalk](#crosswalk)
- iOS 10+
  - [Latest iOS Stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/)


#### Crosswalk

[Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) is a project specifically for Android versions `4.1` to `4.3`, which upgrades Android's internal system webview with an updated webview based on Google's Chromium. However, for modern Android devices starting at Android `5.0`, it's no longer recommended.


## Desktop

Ionic not only works great on mobile devices, but since it's still just web tech it works great on desktop browsers too.

- Chrome
- Safari
- Edge

For more information on desktop layouts, please see the [cross platform](/docs/guide/cross-platform) docs.
