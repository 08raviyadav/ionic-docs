## What is Ionic Framework

Ionic Framework is an open source (MIT) UI toolkit that enables developers to build performant, high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Ionic Framework is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app. This means that it’s not a replacement for PhoneGap or your favorite JavaScript framework. Instead, Ionic fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: the front-end. Check out “Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?” to get a good understanding of Ionic’s core philosophy and goals.

Ionic currently requires Angular in order to work at its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you’ll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things. In the future, Ionic plans to become more agnostic in order to support a broader variety of JavaScript frameworks.

### License

Ionic Framework is completely free and open source, released under the permissive MIT license, which means you can use Ionic in personal or commercial projects for free. For example, MIT is the same license used by such popular projects as jQuery and Ruby on Rails.

Some directives can take an “argument”, denoted by a colon after the directive name. For example, the v-bind directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`
* Restrictions: This option is only available in the full build, with in-browser compilation.
* Details: When set to true, will preserve and render HTML comments found in templates. The
	default behavior is discarding them.
