# Core Concepts

<!-- TOC goes here -->

<p class='intro' markdown='1'>
If you’re completely new to Ionic Framework app development, it can be helpful to get a high-level understanding of the core philosophy, concepts, and tools behind the project. Before diving into complex topics, we’ll cover the basics here to help you familiarize yourself with what Ionic is and how it works.

## App Structure

Ionic Framework app structure goes here.

## UI Components

Ionic Framework comes with a library of [UI Components](#), which are reusable elements that serve as the building blocks for your app. Components are pre-designed, composed of HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript. Every Ionic component adapts to the platform on which your app is running. We call this Platform Continuity and go more in depth on how it works in Theming. 

## Navigation

Navigation works like a stack — push a page to the stack to navigate to it, and pop to go back. Modals and alerts can also be displayed by pushing them onto the navigation stack.

### Routing

Depending on which framework you're work with, it’s recommended to use either the officially-supported ionic router or Angular's ngRouter. For more details, see our documentation.

## Theming

Themes are sets of styles that get applied to an app. Ionic uses a light theme by default, but it also comes with a dark theme. In addition to theming, Ionic’s Platform Continuity enables components to have platform-specific styles. This means the app’s styles will change based on the platform (iOS, Android, etc.) on which it’s being run, offering your users an experience with which they’re familiar.
